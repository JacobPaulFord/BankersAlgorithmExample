# BankersAlgorithmExample
An example implementation of the Bankers algorithm for determining if a system is in a safe state. 


No additional actions need to be taken beyond normal comalation for this program, 
  short of needing the input files to be in the same folder as the program.
  
As such, compile with the command:
  g++ algorithm.cpp -o algorithm.exe
  
And run with the command:
  ./algorithm.exe
  
For your traditional unix based system. 
    
  
    
A description of the files provided (by folder)

Documentation:
1) Documentation.pdf
------ A description of what the program does and how the
   Bankers algorithm works, as an answer to the question provided with the assignement
3) Examples and Results.pdf
------ Provided results of what should be printed to the
   terminal for each of the three provided input files when compiled properly

Program Files:
1) algorithm.cpp
------ The actual c++ code which will be compiled, as well as a
   description regarding the neccessary format of the input files,
   and where to change the name of the input file.
2) input.txt
------ First provided example of data for the program to work with.
   This is what is used by default.
3) input2.txt
------ A second input file option, shoing how to properly add more resources
   compared to input.txt.
4) input3.txt
------ A third input file option, showing how to properly add an additional
   process compared to input.txt.
